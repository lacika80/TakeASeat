# TakeASeat
## Restaurant table reservation management software (language: Hungarian)
I am making this project to practice using javascript with React and Node.js

Base functions which i would like to work:
- login with google and with normal email/pw (with verification, forgotten pw, remember me function)
- create restaurant(s)
- create tables (list view)
- take, delete reservation
- permission system (with local restaurant and global admin)

Later plans:
- fine tunings
- mobile app
- etc. (*I will write later*)
